This is guide going over some gotchas when playing Stellaris and coming from another 4x game like Civ. Certain systems are going to seem like they aren't working right, so I'll attempt to explain them here.

Stellaris too many systems to explain in a beginner's guide, so I'll only cover the bare basics to get started playing. You don't need to be a master of every little thing in Stellaris to enjoy playing it.

The more important part is the [Basic Gameplay](#basic-gameplay) section, resources is more of an appendix section.

# Basic Gameplay
![Start](/images/start.jpg "start")
Is the zoomed in screenshot of a star system. To zoom out to the galaxy view, you can hit the M key.
![zoomed_out](/images/zoomed_out.jpg "zoomed_out")

At the top, you can see what the same suggests for important things to do:
![guided_tasks](/images/guided_tasks.png "guided_tasks")

These guided tasks are probably the best guide for what you should take care of. Clicking on them will bring up a menu where you can interact with them, in this case bringing up the [research](#research) menu. I can queue up three researches to clear the menu.

On the right, you can see the Outliner, which is a summary of everything you own.
![outliner](/images/outliner.png "outliner")

## Surveying

One unique thing about Stellaris is that your ships can't visit anywhere you see on the map. As you can see in the zoomed out view, the points on the map (star systems) are connected by lines (starlanes). Moreover, if you hover on a star system you haven't visited before, it'll look like this:
![unsurveyed](/images/unsurveyed.png "unsurveyed")
Meaning we don't know anything about this particular star system. 

In order to explore a star system, we will need to take a manned science ship to survey it. In order to do this, I can click on the Science Ship under Civilian Ships and right click the star system of interest.
![science_ship_interactions](/images/science_ship_interactions.png "science_ship_interactions")

Hit survey system to get the manned science ship to head out and explore this star system.

### Anomolies
![anomolies](/images/anomolies.png "anomolies")
When surveying, occasionally you'll come across anomolies. These are modifiers on the star system which will affect it in some way. Generally you should research them, but it's a balance between how long it takes, and how much exploring you want to do of other star systems. Researching an anomoly will lock up the science ship for the number of months that it says under research time. You can always go back and research them later if you want by opening up the situation log and looking for them there, 
![left_menu](/images/left_menu.png "left_menu")
![anomoly_menu](/images/anomoly_menu.png "anomoly_menu")

or right clicking a star system with anomolies on it while selecting a science ship.
![science_ship_anomolies](/images/science_ship_anomolies.png "science_ship_anomolies")

## Construction

The other type of civilian ship that you start the game with is called a construction ship. The construction ship is similar to a builder in Civ, but has a couple of key differences: it can't build instantly, but it doesn't disappear after building a few buildings. This means it is feasible to use a single construction ship to build everything in your empire. (though whether suggested or not is a different topic)

Similar to the science ship, click on the construction ship on the Outliner and right click on a star system in your borders to be able to create stations (when available).
![basic_construct](/images/basic_construct.png "basic_construct")
In this case, mining stations are greyed out sicne I don't have enough minerals, but research stations are available since I have enough.

## Building Ships
Building a ship requires a Shipyard. You can see the shipyards you own on the outliner. Clicking on a shipyard on the outeliner will bring up a menu with the starbase it's built on.
![shipyard](/images/shipyard.png "shipyard")
As you can see, it's a module on this starhold you start with. You can build multiple shipyard modules, which will allow you to build ships in parallel.

Clicking on the Shipyard tab on the bottom of this menu brings up this menu with ships you can build:
![shipyard_menu](/images/shipyard_menu.png "shipyard_menu")

The ships here are:
- Corvette, the smallest type of military ship
- Construction ship
- Colony Ship - similar to a settler in Civ
- Science ship

Like in the example for the construction ship, the colony ship is greyed out due to not having enough resources to make one.

In the early game, you want to explore your surroundings as quickly as possible, so I'll queue up a science ship by clicking on it.
![queued_science_ship](/images/queued_science_ship.png "queued_science_ship")

## Manning Ships
![no_leader](/images/no_leader.jpg "no_leader")
When you click on the newly created science ship from the [building ships](#building-ships) section, you'll see it says no leader.
![no_leader_2](/images/no_leader_2.png "no_leader_2")

Science ships are unique in Stellaris in that they can't do anything without a leader.

If you try to survey a system with this ship, it looks like this:
![no_leader_3](/images/no_leader_3.png "no_leader_3")

To hire a leader, simply click on the assign leader portrait to bring up this menu:
![leader_menu](/images/leader_menu.png "leader_menu")
This will show you whether or not a leader is busy or not. In this case, all of them are busy, so to man this ship we'll need to recruit a new leader (recruit button to the right of scientists)
![recruit_menu](/images/recruit_menu.png "recruit_menu")

After hitting recruit, they'll show up on the previous menu like this, and you can simply click on them to assign them to the ship.
![leader_menu_recruited](/images/leader_menu_recruited.png "leader_menu_recruited")
And now we can use this ship to survey.
![science_ship_recruited](/images/science_ship_recruited.png "science_ship_recruited")

## Notifications and Idle ships
Eventually ships will finish doing the jobs that you've queued up. Usually this will give a popup, but if you fail to read them, you can also see if they're idle by looking at the Outliner.
![idle_icon](/images/idle_icon.png "idle_icon")

If they're idle you can feel free to click on them and make them do something else.

## Expansion
Expanding is very different in this game compared to others. Only some star systems have planets on them that are potentially habitable. These will show up as a planet symbol next to the star system it's located in.
![habitable_planet](/images/habitable_planet.png "habitable_planet")

Clicking on this planet will bring up this coloinzation menu.
![colonization_menu](/images/colonization_menu.png "colonization_menu")
However, notice it doesn't allow us to colonize it immediately.
We first have to expand our borders to include a star system
and then settle it with a settler.

To expand your border, you'll need to:
1. Survey the system with a science ship
2. Build an outpost with a construction ship ![build_outpost](/images/build_outpost.png "build_outpost")

After our borders are expanded, our borders will increase like so:
![borders_expanded](/images/borders_expanded.png "borders_expanded")

Now we can open the colonization menu again and colonize the planet if we have enough resources to build a settler.
![colonizing](/images/colonizing.png "colonizing")

Upon clicking on this settler and picking a name for the planet, construction of a settler will be queued upon your shipyard and the settler will automatically try to settle the planet.

## Planet Management
Your planets will be the at the top of your Outliner.
![planets](/images/planets.png "planets")

You can click on them to open the planet management menu.
![planet_menu](/images/planet_menu.png "planet_menu")
As you can see, there's a lot here, and we're nicely stable.

In this guide, I'll only go over the Districts and the population tabs.
### Districts
The districts section will control what districts your planet has.
![districts](/images/districts.png "districts")
The "6" indicates how many can be built, and hovering over the district will tell you what building that district will provide.

### Population
One thing you may notice after you finish building a district is that it may not seem to do anything. The reason is that districts only provide space for jobs, it won't actually fill them.
![unfilled_pops](/images/unfilled_pops.png "unfilled_pops")
Like in this screenshot, there's only 4 out of 6 slots filled. You can (arbitrarily) reassign workers and prioritize a certain kind of worker by clicking on the job you want people to be assigned to. Keep in mind it's all-or-nothing, so prioritizing a job will immediately prioritize all other jobs in its favor.

## Warfare
Not covered. But basically move your military fleet onto a hostile fleet and they'll automatically engage each other.

# Resources

The key resources in this game can be found at the top. They'll have a base number and a monthly growth amount.

![top](/images/top.png "top")

The most familiar ones are probably these:
![resources](/images/resources.png "resources")

<sub>From left to right: Energy Credits, Minerals, Food, Consumer Goods, Alloys</sub>

Here's some very brief explanations of them, as they should be very familiar to players of other 4x games like Civ.

## Energy Credits
Money. This is pretty much just the universal currency.

## Minerals
Kind of a base material, this is mostly used for basic constructions, but in general it'll be very easy to obtain.

## Food
Food. It'll be used to feed your people, and there will be a increasing need for it as your population grows.

## Consumer Goods
These are one of the refined version of minerals. This is a resource somewhat similar to food in that for the species that use consumer goods, they'll be used to keep your people happy, and as population grows more and more of them will be needed.

## Alloys
These are the other refined versions of minerals. This is a key resource, and is used to create pretty much everything, from new ships to new expansions.

## Other resources
There's some other resources to the right of the "main" resources from above. These are more abstract resources and aren't interacted with in the same way as the main resources. In general, when learning this game I wouldn't focus too much on any of these resources other than sprawl. Most of these "abstract" resources will increase naturally over time. You can click on them in-game and they'll usually pull up a menu if there's any meaningful interaction with them.

![sub_resources](/images/sub_resources.png "sub_resources")
<sub>From left to right: Influence, Unity, Research, Strategics, Sprawl, Envoys, Population, Starbase Capacity, Naval Capacity</sub>

## Influence
Early on it's to restrict expansion speed as its used for creating new outposts. In war, it's used to making claims, which allow you to claim systems to take in war.

## Unity

**This may seem like a really complex system, but you basically only interact with it once every few minutes and it lets you pick a some perks for your nation. That's it.**

Having unity will eventually allow you to take traditions, which will eventually give you ascensions. Here's an example of what a tradition might do. You can open this menu by clicking on the Unity icon on the top bar.
![traditions](/images/traditions.png "traditions")
And here's what an example ascension might do.
![ascensions](/images/ascensions.png "ascensions")

The relationship between unity, traditions, and ascensions looks like this: 
1. You get unity over time. (no action needed)
2. After hitting a unity threshold, you can adopt a tradition. (choose something here)
3. Get more unity over time (no action needed)
4. Unlock some stuff under the tradition
![sub_traditions](/images/sub_traditions.png "sub_traditions")
5. After picking 5 things under one tradition, pick an ascension perk. 
6. Get some more unity (no action needed)

## Research
This is the same as in other games, but in Stellaris you're allowed to research three technologies at the same time, physics, society, and engineering. There will be different values for each type of research, as shown here.

![researches](/images/researches.png "researches")

Keep in mind that researches that appear in the research menu are **random**!
![research_menu](/images/research_menu.png "research_menu")

While higher-tier researches do have dependencies on earlier researches, you'll need to unlock them by researching things with this icon:
![research_unlock](/images/research_unlock.png "research_unlock")


## Strategics
Used for late game buildings and ships. You need to reach researches them to even collect them. Here are the strategics in the game.

![strategics](/images/strategics.png "strategics")

## Sprawl
The game can probably explain sprawl way better than I can.
![sprawl](/images/sprawl.png "sprawl")

Sprawl is kind of an invisible force on the game. In general it means "don't over-expand too much". Sprawl will greatly increase how long it takes for you to research things and how much it costs to upkeep your fleets. 

**General rule of thumb for sprawl: It's okay to go over a little, but don't let it double or triple your cap. Administrative capacity will increase your sprawl cap.**

## Envoys
Send them to other nations to increase standing with them.

## Population
Population

## Starbase Capacity
Similar to sprawl. Will increase upkeep cost if you have too many.

## Naval Capacity
How big your navy can be. You can go over the max capacity, but it will **greatly** increase fleet upkeep cost.
